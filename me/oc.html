		sylvie was originally literally just a blank template, a white cat.<br>
		as expected, her design changed over time, the first feature being a green bandana,
		which is now no longer as important as it was before, for some reason..<br>
		i do sometimes wish i changed her fur color.. probably not going to do that in the future either<br>
		<img src="sylvolution.png"
		alt='"evolution of sylvie summarised", 6 pixel art images of sylvie, the first being just a white cat; then with a bandana; that and a jacket; then also more fluff on the head; then also a flower; and the last one without a bandana, different clothes, and an outline'>

		<center><h2>lore!?!?</h2></center>
		there is no crazy lore or anything, its just me, but meow, and mrrp, mrrow mew~ meoooow<br><br>
		yet somehow <i title="violence, unannounced">extreme kitty violence</i> exists, heck, i think even
		<i title="cat adventure DX, release date: 30th feb '97">cat magic</i> was a thing at some point<br>
		for some weird reason i like having her in some stories.. which in theory means sylvie appears more than once in
		one timeline, as if the consistency there wasnt bad enough already<br>
		go thank your favourite higher power
		<i title='"thank god im atheist" - some internet user'>(if any)</i> for not making me a writer<br>

		<center><h2>ref</h2></center>
