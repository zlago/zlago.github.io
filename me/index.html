		hello, i call myself 'sylvie' and use the username 'zlago', i develop silly overscoped games for stupidly underpowered hardware for bragging rights for making something run at 60 fps on hardware x1000 worse than my own then feel like i shouldnt brag about it<br><br>
		thats assuming i could actually develop for that stuff though.. as of 2023-05-18, out of ~6 serious projects, only 2 released, and im unhappy with both. did i mention i also had minor projects?<br><br>
		and yet, despite that, some people appear to like some of my failed projects.<br>
		and i dont know why..<br>
		<br><span title="every image (and some text) has a 'title', but you already knew that, right? :3">hint</span>
		<hr>i dont think theres more i could say, and outside of that
		i have practically no life..<br>i do belong to a cute foxgirl though
