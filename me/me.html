			hello, i call myself 'sylvie'<br><br>
			i develop silly overscoped games for stupidly underpowered hardware<br><br>
			i value optimized and accessible software, since my hardware doesnt let me run much<br><br>
			i struggle to finish projects, but that doesnt seem to discourage me<br><br>
			i love hearing from others that they like what i do<br><br>
			i struggle to find good friends IRL, but i manage really well online<br><br>
			i hate to say that, but i can be quite nice at times, my girlfriend even calls me sweet<hr>
		</span>
		<div class="block">
			i could keep going for a lot longer, probably, but it would be full of
			"despite how i feel", "while i think otherwise", "i cannot prove that im not",
			since i really disagree with that people think of me
