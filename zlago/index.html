		so i just really needed an account name and couldnt think of anything actually good<br>
		and it just sort of.. stuck, and its still a unique-ish string that i use for account names<br><br>
		(yes, it has no canonical meaning. if its a swear word in some language i never heard of, then i probably dont care about that)<br><br>
